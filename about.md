I am a DPhil candidate at the University of Oxford and at the Alan Turing Institute. 

I am interested in two main strands of research. 

- The first focuses on studying deep probabilistic models, specifically their adversarial robustness and their ability to build representations that are factorisable and human-interpretable. 

- The second uses functional analysis and Langevin dynamics to study commonly used regularisation methods, such as Gaussian noise injections.
